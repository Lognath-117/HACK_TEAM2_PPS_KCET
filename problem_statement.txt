Problem Statement:
Predict If a Person Will Switch Jobs
Build a classification model to predict whether an individual is likely to switch jobs within the next 6 months. The model should be based on key features collected from survey responses, such as:
* Job satisfaction level (Scale: 1 to 5)

* Salary expectations

* Work-life balance satisfaction

* Commute time

* Number of years in the current job

The target variable is:
   * 1 → Will Switch

   * 0 → Will Stay

Use Logistic Regression as the algorithm for this binary classification task. Evaluate the model using classification metrics such as:
      * Accuracy

      * Precision

      * Recall

      * F1 Score
