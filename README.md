Project Explanation: Career Shift Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether a person will switch jobs within the next 6 months using Logistic Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
We collected data from students and working individuals using a Google Form, asking questions like:
How satisfied are you with your job?
What are your salary expectations?
How is your work-life balance?
How long is your daily commute?
How many years have you worked in your current job?
Based on this information, the machine learning model learns patterns and predicts if a person is likely to stay (0) or switch jobs (1).
Key Steps:
Data Collection – Using Google Forms
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and preparing the data
Model Training – Using Logistic Regression
Evaluation – Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Saving the Model – In .pkl format
Making Predictions – Testing with sample inputs
Submission – Uploading code and results to GitHub
This project helps understand how machine learning can be used in career prediction and HR analytics.
